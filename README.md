# go-shopping-poc

This project serves as a vehicle to learn the Go programming language, project structures, and methodologies by actually implementing something.

The goal of the project will be to provide backend services based on an event-driven architecture to support a web-based shopping application.  

These services have previously been implemented using Java and Quarkus.  The architecture will remain largely the same, but I do expect that the tools and approaches used to implement that architecture will change along with the programming language.

More details to be added as the project progresses.

## Project Structure
The initial structure will be loosely based on the project-layout standard outlined here:
[Golang Standards - Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)
